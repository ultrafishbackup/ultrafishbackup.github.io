# CV Chain System

> **A Curriculum Vitae System based on Blockchain Technology**

**Features:** 
- CV Chain is a system based on blockchain technology. 
- Users can store and check their CVs on the blockchain, which is difficult to hack and tamper with, taking full advantage of the features to ensure the confidentiality of the information.
